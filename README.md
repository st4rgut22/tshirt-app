Created an application selling t-shirts using Activities, Intents, and HTTP requests. 
For the server requests, I created a database on my local server. 
You can do the same to test this app by installing XAMPP on your computer, identifying your IP address, and replacing the string PRODUCT_URL in ShopActivity.java. 
Make sure you have also added the Glide and Volley libraries as dependencies to your project. 
I used Android Studio IDE to run the app. 

Here is a demo of my app:
